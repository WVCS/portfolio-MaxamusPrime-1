    <p> The Brodway Limited Imports Big Boy is the most detailed Big Boy on the market. It has the First even syncronized chuffing with the smoke box that is installed inside. Also for the first time in HO history the Brodway Big Boy has a steaming whistle feature. This means steam will come out of the whistle when the whitsle is blown. What once could only be done in larger scales has now been brought to HO. The Brodway engine also weighs more than the Genisis which increases its pulling power making it a stronger engine. </p>

      <p>   The Athearn Genisis big boy is one of the most popular Big boy models out there. Even though their detail doesnt match the fine detail of Brodway limited and the amazing smoke features that the Brodway Big boy offer. The athearn Big Boy is known to be much more reliable in terms of function. Athearn Genisis is known for the perfectly operating locomotives and easy decoder minipulation options. The Big Boy comes equipped with the latest Tsunami 2 sound decoder. The steam engine come pre equipped with DCC and sound which means its ready to roll right out of the box. </P>
